### Technical Debt Assessment Framework

#### Technical Debt Classification

**Severity Levels:**
- **Critical**: Blocks new feature development or causes production issues
- **High**: Significantly impacts development velocity or system performance
- **Medium**: Moderate impact on maintainability or performance
- **Low**: Minor improvements that would be nice to have

**Categories:**
- **Code Quality**: Poor code structure, lack of tests, code duplication
- **Architecture**: Outdated patterns, tight coupling, scalability limitations
- **Infrastructure**: Legacy systems, manual processes, security vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Missing or outdated documentation, unclear specifications

#### Technical Debt Scoring Matrix

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Business Impact | 30% | X | X * 0.3 |
| Development Velocity Impact | 25% | X | X * 0.25 |
| Maintenance Cost | 20% | X | X * 0.2 |
| Risk Level | 15% | X | X * 0.15 |
| Effort to Fix | 10% | X | X * 0.1 |
| **Total Score** | | | **Sum** |

#### Technical Debt Prioritization Process

1. **Identification**
   - Regular code reviews identify technical debt
   - Architecture reviews surface systemic issues
   - Developer feedback and pain point reporting

2. **Assessment**
   - Apply scoring matrix to each identified item
   - Estimate effort required for remediation
   - Assess business impact and urgency

3. **Prioritization**

   - Consider sprint capacity and team skills
   - Balance with feature development priorities

4. **Planning**
   - Allocate 20% of sprint capacity to technical debt
   - Create remediation tickets with clear acceptance criteria
   - Assign to appropriate team members

5. **Tracking**
   - Monitor progress in weekly architecture syncs
   - Update technical debt register monthly
   - Report on technical debt metrics quarterly
