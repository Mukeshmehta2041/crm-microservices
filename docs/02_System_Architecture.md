## Architecture Overview

The CRM platform follows a cloud-native, microservices architecture designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The system is built using Java-based microservices deployed on Kubernetes, with event-driven communication patterns and comprehensive observability.

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Microservices Architecture**: Domain-driven service boundaries
- **Event-Driven Design**: Asynchronous communication via message brokers
- **API-First Approach**: RESTful and GraphQL APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- **Cloud-Native**: Containerized deployment with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Multi-Tenant**: Secure tenant isolation at application and data layers
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing

### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Communication

**REST APIs**
- **Usage**: Client-facing operations, real-time queries, CRUD operations
- **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS with JSON payloads
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with OAuth2
- **Error Handling**: Standardized HTTP status codes and error responses
- **Versioning**: URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/contacts`)

```yaml
REST API Standards:
  Base URL: https://api.crm.company.com/v1
  Authentication: Bearer JWT tokens
  Content-Type: application/json
  Error Format:
    error:
      code: string
      message: string
      details: object
  Rate Limiting: 1000 requests/hour per user
```

**gRPC APIs**
- **Usage**: High-performance service-to-service communication
- **Protocol**: HTTP/2 with Protocol Buffers
- **Authentication**: mTLS certificates and JWT tokens
- **Error Handling**: gRPC status codes with detailed error messages
- **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes service discovery with load balancing

```protobuf
// Example gRPC service definition
service ContactService {
  rpc GetContact(GetContactRequest) returns (ContactResponse);
  rpc CreateContact(CreateContactRequest) returns (ContactResponse);
  rpc UpdateContact(UpdateContactRequest) returns (ContactResponse);
  rpc DeleteContact(DeleteContactRequest) returns (Empty);
  rpc SearchContacts(SearchContactsRequest) returns (SearchContactsResponse);
}
```

#### Asynchronous Communication

**Event-Driven Messaging Architecture**

The platform uses Apache Kafka for event streaming and RabbitMQ for task queues:

**Apache Kafka Configuration**
- **Topics**: Domain-specific topics (contacts.events, deals.events, activities.events)
- **Partitioning**: By tenant ID for scalability and isolation
- **Retention**: 7 days for events, 30 days for audit events
- **Replication**: 3 replicas for high availability

```yaml
Kafka Topics:
  contacts.lifecycle:
    partitions: 12
    replication: 3
    retention: 168h
  deals.pipeline:
    partitions: 12
    replication: 3
    retention: 168h
  activities.tracking:
    partitions: 6
    replication: 3
    retention: 72h
  audit.events:
    partitions: 24
    replication: 3
    retention: 720h
```

**Event Schema Standards**

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "contact.created|contact.updated|contact.deleted",
  "tenantId": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "source": "service-name",
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "entityId": "uuid",
    "entityType": "contact",
    "changes": {},
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

**RabbitMQ Configuration**
- **Queues**: Task-specific queues with dead letter queues
- **Exchanges**: Topic exchanges for routing flexibility
- **Durability**: Persistent queues and messages
- **Acknowledgments**: Manual acknowledgments for reliability

```yaml
RabbitMQ Queues:
  notification.email:
    durable: true
    auto_delete: false
    dlq: notification.email.dlq
  workflow.execution:
    durable: true
    auto_delete: false
    dlq: workflow.execution.dlq
  integration.sync:
    durable: true
    auto_delete: false
    dlq: integration.sync.dlq
```

### API Gateway Configuration and Routing

#### Kong API Gateway Setup

**Core Configuration**
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin with health checks
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-endpoint limits
- **Authentication**: JWT plugin with OAuth2 integration
- **Logging**: Request/response logging with correlation IDs
- **Caching**: Response caching for read-heavy endpoints

```yaml
Kong Configuration:
  services:
    contacts-service:
      url: http://contacts-service:8080
      retries: 3
      connect_timeout: 5000
      read_timeout: 60000
    deals-service:
      url: http://deals-service:8080
      retries: 3
      connect_timeout: 5000
      read_timeout: 60000
  
  routes:
    contacts-api:
      service: contacts-service
      paths: ["/api/v1/contacts"]
      methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
    deals-api:
      service: deals-service
      paths: ["/api/v1/deals"]
      methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
  
  plugins:
    - name: jwt
      config:
        secret_is_base64: false
        key_claim_name: iss
    - name: rate-limiting
      config:
        minute: 100
        hour: 1000
    - name: cors
      config:
        origins: ["*"]
        methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
```

**Routing Strategies**

1. **Path-Based Routing**: Routes based on URL paths
   - `/api/v1/contacts/*` → Contacts Service
   - `/api/v1/deals/*` → Deals Service
   - `/api/v1/analytics/*` → Analytics Service

2. **Header-Based Routing**: Routes based on custom headers
