## Overview

### Security Philosophy
The Comprehensive CRM Platform implements a defense-in-depth security strategy, incorporating multiple layers of security controls to protect customer data, ensure system integrity, and maintain service availability. Security is built into every aspect of the platform, from design to deployment and operations.

### Security Objectives
- **Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive customer and business data from unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized modifications
- **Availability**: Maintain system uptime and service accessibility
- **Accountability**: Provide comprehensive audit trails and access logging
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)

### Security Principles
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access rights
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Security by Design**: Security integrated from the beginning
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response

### API Security

#### API Authentication
```yaml
Authentication Methods:
  JWT Bearer Tokens:
    - RS256 signature algorithm
    - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
    - Long-lived refresh tokens (30 days)
    - Token rotation on refresh
    - Revocation support
  
  API Keys:
    - Service-to-service authentication
    - Scoped permissions
    - Rate limiting per key
    - Rotation policies
    - Usage monitoring
  
  OAuth 2.0:
    - Authorization code flow
    - Client credentials flow
    - PKCE for public clients
    - Scope-based authorization
    - Token introspection

Token Validation:
  Validation Steps:
    1. Signature verification
    2. Expiration check
    3. Issuer validation
    4. Audience validation
    5. Scope verification
    6. Revocation check
  
  Caching Strategy:
    - Token validation results cached
    - 5-minute cache TTL
    - Distributed cache for scalability
    - Cache invalidation on revocation
```

#### API Authorization
```yaml
Authorization Patterns:
  Resource-Based:
    - URL path authorization
    - HTTP method restrictions
    - Resource ownership validation
    - Hierarchical permissions
  
  Attribute-Based:
    - User attributes (role, department)
    - Resource attributes (sensitivity, type)
    - Environmental attributes (time, location)
    - Dynamic policy evaluation
  
  Context-Aware:
    - Request context analysis
    - Risk-based decisions
    - Adaptive authentication
    - Behavioral analysis

Policy Engine:
  Policy Language: Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego
  Policy Storage: Git-based version control
  Policy Evaluation: Real-time decision engine
  Policy Testing: Automated policy validation
  
  Example Policy:
    ```rego
    package crm.authz
    
    default allow = false
    
    # Allow users to read their own profile
    allow {
        input.method == "GET"
        input.path == ["users", input.user.id]
    }
    
    # Allow sales reps to manage their own contacts
    allow {
        input.method in ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH"]
        input.path[0] == "contacts"
        input.user.role == "sales_rep"
        contact_owner == input.user.id
    }
    
    # Allow managers to access team data
    allow {
        input.user.role == "sales_manager"
        team_member in input.user.team_members
        resource_owner == team_member
    }
    ```
