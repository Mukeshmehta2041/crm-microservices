## Code Review Process

### 1. Pre-Review Preparation
- Ensure all automated checks pass (CI/CD, tests, code quality)

- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions
- Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized

### 2. Review Assignment
- Assign at least **2 reviewers** for each pull request
- Include a senior developer for complex changes
- Assign domain experts for specific areas
- Rotate reviewers to spread knowledge

### 3. Review Timeline
- **Initial review**: Within 24 hours of assignment
- **Follow-up reviews**: Within 4 hours of updates
- **Emergency fixes**: Within 2 hours

### 4. Approval Process
- Require **2 approvals** before merging
- All conversations must be resolved
- All automated checks must pass
- Author can merge after approvals

## What to Look For

### 1. Functionality
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are edge cases handled properly?
- Is error handling appropriate?
- Are there any logical errors?

### 2. Design and Architecture

- Is the design consistent with existing patterns?
- Are abstractions appropriate?
- Is the code extensible and maintainable?

### 3. Code Quality
- Is the code readable and well-structured?
- Are naming conventions followed?
- Is the code properly formatted?
- Are there any code smells?

### 4. Performance
- Are there any obvious performance issues?
- Is database access optimized?
- Are resources properly managed?
- Is caching used appropriately?

### 5. Security
- Are inputs properly validated?
- Is sensitive data handled securely?
- Are authentication and authorization correct?
- Are there any security vulnerabilities?

### 6. Testing
- Are there adequate unit tests?
- Do integration tests cover the main scenarios?
- Is test coverage sufficient?
- Are tests meaningful and maintainable?

## Best Practices for Authors

### Before Submitting
1. **Self-review your code**
   - Read through your changes as if you were reviewing someone else's code
   - Check for obvious issues and improvements
   - Ensure code follows established patterns

2. **Write clear descriptions**
   - Explain what the change does and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Reference related issues or tickets
   - Highlight areas that need special attention

3. **Keep PRs focused**
   - One feature or fix per pull request
   - Avoid mixing refactoring with new features
   - Keep changes reasonably sized (< 400 lines when possible)

4. **Ensure quality**
   - All tests pass
   - Code coverage meets requirements
   - Static analysis tools pass
   - Documentation is updated

### During Review
1. **Respond promptly**
   - Address feedback within 24 hours
   - Ask for clarification if comments are unclear
   - Explain your reasoning for design decisions

2. **Be open to feedback**
   - Consider all suggestions seriously
   - Don't take criticism personally
   - Learn from the review process

3. **Make requested changes**
   - Address all feedback before requesting re-review
   - Mark conversations as resolved when fixed
   - Add comments explaining your changes

## Best Practices for Reviewers

### Review Approach
1. **Understand the context**
   - Read the PR description and related issues
   - Understand the business requirements
   - Consider the broader system impact

2. **Be thorough but efficient**
   - Focus on important issues first
   - Don't nitpick minor style issues if tools can catch them
   - Balance thoroughness with review speed

3. **Provide constructive feedback**
   - Explain the reasoning behind your suggestions
   - Offer specific solutions, not just problems
   - Distinguish between must-fix and nice-to-have items

### Feedback Guidelines
1. **Be respectful and professional**
   - Focus on the code, not the person
   - Use "we" instead of "you" when possible
   - Acknowledge good practices and improvements

2. **Be specific and actionable**
   - Point to specific lines of code
   - Provide examples of better approaches
   - Explain the impact of issues you identify

3. **Categorize your feedback**
   - **Critical**: Must be fixed before merging
   - **Important**: Should be addressed
   - **Suggestion**: Nice to have improvement
   - **Question**: Seeking clarification

### Example Feedback
```
// Good feedback
Critical: This method doesn't handle the case where user is null, 
which could cause a NullPointerException. Consider adding a null check 
or using Optional.

Suggestion: Consider extracting this complex validation logic into a 
separate method to improve readability.

Question: Why did you choose to use a HashMap here instead of a LinkedHashMap? 
Is order preservation not important?

// Poor feedback
This is wrong.
Bad naming.
Fix this.
```
