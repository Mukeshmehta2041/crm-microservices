# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a comprehensive, end-to-end API documentation file that covers every single API endpoint needed to build the complete CRM platform. This documentation will serve as the definitive reference for developers to implement all microservices without missing any functionality. The API documentation must be exhaustive, covering all core modules, advanced features, platform services, and integration points.
