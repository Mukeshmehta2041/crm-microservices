## Testing Strategy

### API Testing Approach
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual endpoint logic
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions
3. **Contract Tests**: Verify API contracts
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
5. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
6. **Security Tests**: Authentication and authorization testing

### Test Data Management
- Use test containers for database testing
- Mock external service dependencies
- Implement data factories for test data generation
- Use separate test databases per service
- Clean up test data after each test run

This comprehensive API design covers all endpoints needed to build the complete CRM platform, ensuring no functionality is missed during implementation.
