# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for optimizing the Authentication Service and User Management Service to fully implement the comprehensive API endpoints as documented in the CRM Platform API Documentation. The current implementations are basic and need to be enhanced to provide OAuth2 flows, MFA, session management, comprehensive user management, role-based access control, and team management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OAuth2 Authorization Flows

**User Story:** As a third-party application developer, I want to integrate with the CRM platform using OAuth2 flows, so that I can securely access user data with proper authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN an authorization code is exchanged THEN the system SHALL return access and refresh tokens
3. WHEN a client credentials grant is requested THEN the system SHALL authenticate the client and return appropriate tokens
4. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL generate new access tokens
5. WHEN a token is revoked THEN the system SHALL invalidate the token immediately
6. WHEN user info is requested with a valid token THEN the system SHALL return user profile information

### Requirement 2: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to enable multi-factor authentication, so that my account has an additional layer of security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MFA setup is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide TOTP secret and QR code
2. WHEN MFA setup is verified THEN the system SHALL enable MFA for the user account
3. WHEN login requires MFA THEN the system SHALL prompt for the second factor
4. WHEN MFA is verified THEN the system SHALL complete the authentication process
5. WHEN backup codes are requested THEN the system SHALL provide one-time use codes
6. WHEN MFA is disabled THEN the system SHALL require current password and MFA code

### Requirement 3: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my active sessions across different devices, so that I can maintain security and control over my account access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN active sessions are requested THEN the system SHALL list all current user sessions with device information
2. WHEN a specific session is terminated THEN the system SHALL invalidate that session only
3. WHEN all sessions are terminated THEN the system SHALL invalidate all sessions except the current one
4. WHEN session validation is requested THEN the system SHALL verify session validity and return status
5. WHEN current session info is requested THEN the system SHALL return detailed session information

### Requirement 4: Password Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive password management capabilities, so that I can securely manage my account credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link via email
2. WHEN password reset is confirmed with valid token THEN the system SHALL update the password
3. WHEN password is changed THEN the system SHALL require current password verification
4. WHEN password is updated THEN the system SHALL optionally logout other sessions
5. WHEN password policies are enforced THEN the system SHALL validate complexity requirements

### Requirement 5: Email Verification

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want email verification capabilities, so that user email addresses are validated and trusted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email verification is requested THEN the system SHALL send verification email with secure token
2. WHEN verification token is submitted THEN the system SHALL mark email as verified
3. WHEN verification email resend is requested THEN the system SHALL send new verification email
4. WHEN verification expires THEN the system SHALL require new verification request

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive User Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive user management capabilities, so that I can effectively manage user accounts, roles, and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user is created THEN the system SHALL support all profile fields and send welcome email
2. WHEN user is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return complete profile with roles and team information
3. WHEN user is updated THEN the system SHALL support partial updates and maintain audit trail
4. WHEN user is deleted THEN the system SHALL support data transfer and anonymization options
5. WHEN users are listed THEN the system SHALL support filtering, sorting, and pagination
6. WHEN user is activated/deactivated THEN the system SHALL update status and handle access appropriately

### Requirement 7: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access to platform features and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN role is assigned to user THEN the system SHALL grant associated permissions
2. WHEN role is removed from user THEN the system SHALL revoke associated permissions
3. WHEN user roles are requested THEN the system SHALL return all assigned roles with details
4. WHEN effective permissions are requested THEN the system SHALL return computed permissions from all sources
5. WHEN role assignment expires THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke the role

### Requirement 8: Team Management

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want to organize users into teams, so that I can manage group permissions and collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team is created THEN the system SHALL establish team structure with manager and members
2. WHEN team is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return complete team information including statistics
3. WHEN team is updated THEN the system SHALL support manager changes and settings updates
4. WHEN team member is added THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate team permissions
5. WHEN team member is removed THEN the system SHALL revoke team-specific permissions
6. WHEN teams are listed THEN the system SHALL support filtering and include team statistics

### Requirement 9: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my detailed profile information, so that I can maintain accurate personal and professional information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive profile information
2. WHEN profile is updated THEN the system SHALL support partial updates of all profile sections
3. WHEN avatar is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process and store profile image
4. WHEN preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL save user-specific settings
5. WHEN profile visibility is configured THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings

### Requirement 10: API Response Standardization

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent response formats across all endpoints, so that I can reliably process API responses.

2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error information with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN pagination is used THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive pagination metadata
4. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL include rate limit headers
5. WHEN request tracing is enabled THEN the system SHALL include request correlation IDs
