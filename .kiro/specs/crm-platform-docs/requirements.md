# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating comprehensive technical documentation for a scalable, enterprise-grade CRM platform built with Java microservices. The platform will compete with industry leaders like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho while introducing unique differentiating features. The documentation must cover all aspects from requirements and architecture to implementation guidelines and testing strategies, serving as a complete blueprint for building this innovative CRM solution.
