# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The notification service will be a centralized microservice responsible for consuming events from all other CRM platform services via Kafka topics and delivering notifications to users through multiple channels (email, SMS, push notifications, in-app notifications). This service will provide real-time and scheduled notification capabilities while maintaining user preferences and notification history.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to receive notifications about important events in the system, so that I can stay informed about activities relevant to my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service publishes an event to Kafka THEN the notification service SHALL consume the event and determine if notifications are required
2. WHEN a notification is triggered THEN the system SHALL check user notification preferences before sending
3. WHEN a user has notifications enabled THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications through their preferred channels
4. WHEN a notification is sent THEN the system SHALL log the delivery status and maintain audit trail

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to configure my notification preferences, so that I only receive notifications that are relevant to me through my preferred channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses notification settings THEN the system SHALL display all available notification types and channels
2. WHEN a user updates notification preferences THEN the system SHALL save the preferences and apply them to future notifications
3. WHEN a user disables a notification type THEN the system SHALL not send notifications of that type to the user
4. WHEN a user selects notification channels THEN the system SHALL only use those channels for delivery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage notification templates and rules, so that I can customize notification content and delivery logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a notification template THEN the system SHALL validate the template format and save it
2. WHEN an event matches notification rules THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate template for content generation
3. WHEN a template is updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to new notifications immediately
4. WHEN notification rules are modified THEN the system SHALL validate the rules and update the processing logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to view my notification history, so that I can review past notifications and manage my notification settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests notification history THEN the system SHALL display notifications with timestamps, content, and delivery status
2. WHEN a user marks notifications as read THEN the system SHALL update the read status
3. WHEN a user searches notification history THEN the system SHALL filter results based on search criteria
4. WHEN notifications exceed retention period THEN the system SHALL archive or delete old notifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor notification delivery metrics, so that I can ensure the notification system is performing effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are processed THEN the system SHALL track delivery success rates, failure rates, and response times
2. WHEN delivery failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for administrators
4. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time and historical notification analytics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want to receive real-time in-app notifications, so that I can be immediately informed of important events while using the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is active in the application THEN the system SHALL deliver real-time notifications via WebSocket
2. WHEN a notification is delivered THEN the system SHALL display it in the user interface with appropriate styling
3. WHEN a user interacts with a notification THEN the system SHALL handle the interaction and update notification status
4. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for delivery when they return

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system, I want to handle notification delivery failures gracefully, so that important notifications are not lost due to temporary issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry delivery using exponential backoff strategy
2. WHEN maximum retry attempts are reached THEN the system SHALL log the failure and optionally use alternative delivery channels
3. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue notifications and retry when services are restored
4. WHEN critical notifications fail THEN the system SHALL escalate to administrators and attempt alternative delivery methods
